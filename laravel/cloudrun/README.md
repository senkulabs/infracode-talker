# Deploy Laravel on Cloud Run

TLDR: Cloud Run is a Google Cloud Platform product to deploy container-based app. I'm using Server Side Up docker-php to deploy Laravel web app into Cloud Run. In this case, I'm successfully deploy Laravel web app into Cloud Run (services + jobs). Please elaborate it with [senkulabs/logcatcher](https://github.com/senkulabs/logcatcher) because that repository has adjust with Server Side Up docker-php.
